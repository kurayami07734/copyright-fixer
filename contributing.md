```yaml
repos:
  - repo: ../copyright-fixer
    rev: <latest_commit_hash>
    hooks:
       - id: copyright-fixer
         args: ["-n", "Acme, Inc.", "-s", "#"]
```

pre-commit install

```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Everytime you make any changes, commit them and update the `rev` in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Stage the change in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and then run the pre-commit
- Run `pre-commit` after every update to ensure all files are checked.
